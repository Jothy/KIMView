# KIMView: An open-source real-time tumour motion, dose, and anatomy visualisation tool for radiotherapy

## Introduction

Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) typically focuses on measuring geometric errors in patientâ€™s anatomy, especially tumor position and methods to account for it. Geometric accuracy is an indirect measure of treatment quality. The metric of most interest in radiotherapy that correlates directly with clinical outcomes is dose to tumour and critical organs [[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20171515/). The goal of this project is to develop an open-source real-time tumour motion, dose, and anatomy visualisation tool for radiotherapy so the treatment team can see the dose being delivered to the dynamic patient.


## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests



### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
